## main research interests

- Investigating the sources, sinks, and pathways of plastics in agroecosystems
- Developing novel methods for the quantitative analysis of synthetic polymers in soil, for example, using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in combination with advanced data science applications.
