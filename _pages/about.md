I combine environmental chemistry, analytics, ecotoxicology, and soil science to unravel the complexities of anthropogenic pollutants in the environment, scrutinizing their fate and effects from source to sink.

My research focuses on the impact of agriculture on land and water.

## main research interests

- Investigating the sources, sinks, and pathways of plastics and other anthropogenic pollutants in agroecosystems
- Developing novel methods for characterizing and quantifying synthetic polymers in heterogeneous matrices, for example, using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in combination with advanced data science applications
- Elucidating the indirect effects of anthropogenic pollutants on ecosystem functions using biomarkers.
