## main research interests

- Investigating the sources, sinks, and pathways of plastics in agroecosystems
- Developing new tools for the quantitative analysis of plastic debris and other organic compounds in soil, for example, using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA)
