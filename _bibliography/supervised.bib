	title = {Combined strategy to remediate a lindane polluted soil with the white rot fungi {Pleurotus} ostreatus and biochar},
	abstract = {Lindane is a persistent organo-chlorine insecticide which has been extensively used
	worldwide for the control of agricultural, wood and medical pests, despite known its
	tendency to bioaccumulate and its toxicity to non-target organisms. As a result of the high
	persistence and long-time extensive usage, environmental contaminations of global
	dimensions exist. To bioremediate these soils, different bioremediation strategies were
	tested, based on biochar application, and degradation by the white rot fungi Pleurotus
	ostreatus, and a combined approach using biochar and P. ostreatus. In order to simulate
	realistic in situ remediation treatments, economically and feasible application rates and
	typical lindane pollution levels were used. The efficiency and effectiveness of each
	remediation treatment in non-sterile and sterile soils during 50 days of incubation was
	evaluated according to lindane dissipation processes (extractable, non-extractable,
	volatilized and mineralized radioactivity) and growth (ergosterol content) and activity
	(respiration) of P. ostreatus and indigenous soil microbes. Fungal treatment and biochar
	application showed best remediation success in terms of lindane dissipation either due to
	mineralization or immobilization. Sterile soils were strongly colonized by P. ostreatus and
	particularly high lindane mineralization (8.73-11.7 \%) and immobilization (16.9-24.5 \%)
	were observed. Non-sterile inoculated soil showed a similar magnitude of immobilization
	(10.54-24 \%) but lower mineralization (2.4-2.7 \%). However, the mechanisms of lindane
	immobilization by P. ostreatus, i.e. whether lindane was only sorbed or also incorporated
	into fungal tissue, still remains to be clarified. Biochar amendments resulted in lower
	volatilization of lindane from soil and had a positive effect on fungal growth in terms of
	respiration rate and visually observable mycelium. Moreover, it enabled a better
	colonization of the non-sterile soil and therefore, biochar amendments might provide a
	useful tool to introduce fungal inoculum for future in situ remediation measures. However,
	the fungal growth (ergosterol content) and lindane mineralization were lower in biochar-
	amended soils. This may be due to the strong sorption of mineralized lindane (<sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>) and
	ergosterol to biochar, which might have resulted in lower recoveries by the methods used.
	A lower extraction efficiency for ergosterol-spiked soils has already been demonstrated in
	this study. It therefore remains to be clarified whether the biochar had a negative effect on
	fungal growth and mineralization or whether this can be attributed to inadequate
	extraction methods. Moreover, it should be examined to what extent common methods for
	measuring the mineralization of a pollutant can be applied to biochar-amended soils, or
	whether the methodologies must be changed for this purpose. In addition, it remains to be
	clarified in the future to what extent these results can be transferred to a field trial.},
